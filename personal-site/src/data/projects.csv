Dockerfile Security Pipeline,A Github Actions pipeline that builds safer containers,Apr 2025,security.png,"This project implements a SLSA Build Level 3 compliant security pipeline for Docker container builds using BuildKit for secure image creation, Trivy and Docker Scout for vulnerability scanning, and Cosign for image signing and attestations. Running on GitHub Actions, the pipeline provides end-to-end container security by generating SBOMs, scanning for CVEs, creating security reports, and implementing keyless signing with in-toto attestations to ensure supply chain integrity from build to deployment.

Object Telecloning,Real-time object cloning and transfering between hands,Jan 2025,cloned.png,"This project detects hands, faces, and objects in real-time, creating an interactive virtual environment where users can replicate and interact with virtual clones of physical objects using gestures like blinking to trigger cloning and teleportation. Built in Python, it uses OpenCV for object rendering and cloning, MediaPipe for detecting hands and facial landmarks, and processes live camera feeds to enable seamless real-time interaction.

DragonDaily,DragonFjord puzzle Reddit game,Dec 2024,dragondaily.png,"DragonDaily is a puzzle game with the goal of isolating the current date with puzzle pieces on the puzzle board in the shortest amount of time. This type of puzzle is called DragonFjord's "Weekday Calendar Puzzle" -- which inspired this game's name. Using Reddit's Devvit, I created this app using blocks for the leaderboard, communication with Redis, and webview for the main puzzle interaction since it required the movement of the puzzle pieces for drag-and-drop and flip-and-rotate movements. Made with: Typescript, Javascript, Redis",https://github.com/NicoleStrel/dragon-daily-devvit,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonDaily/,https://youtu.be/_clWURbtp_Y,https://devpost.com/software/dragondaily
TranspNeRF, Transparent object reconstruction with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), Sep 2023-Apr 2024,wine-transpnerf.gif,"Transparent objects pose a significant challenge for robot manipulation due to reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light. In chemistry robotics, objects like vials and beakers are necessary to be manoeuvred to perform lab tasks by the robot autonomously. To reconstruct these objects, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated the potential of using neural networks by casting rays to capture fine details of 3D objects. The Nerfacto method is used as a baseline for flexibility, reflected rays are calculated, and the Fresnel constant is applied to capture some refractive effect. These modifications remove noise and improve the quality of the reconstructions, which aids robot grasping algorithms in detecting and manipulating these objects in lab settings.

Differential Privacy, Exploring the efficacy of various differential privacy techniques on X-ray images, Oct 2022-Mar 2023,x-ray.png,"Training models require large datasets which are often crowdsourced with sensitive information. The risk is that an adversary network can extract parts of the training data, using publicly available datasets. To address this, differential privacy is one way of adding noise to the data to eliminate the direct translation back to the source while maintaining accuracy. As a baseline, we explore DP-SGD, which embeds differential privacy in Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We also explore the following techniques: DP-SGD with Johnson-Lindenstrauss JL projections, DP-SGD with federated learning, and the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) algorithm.

Gender Bias in word2vec,Debiasing and measuring bias in embeddings,Jan-Apr 2022,nlp.jpeg,"Word embeddings tend to amplify biases found in the datasets they were trained on, which in turn reflect gender biases in society. Our aim with this project was to explore different debiasing methods and ways to measure gender bias on word embeddings created from two datasets: Wikipedia articles and Gutenburg books. We used PyTorch, SkyLearn, and Numpy Python libraries to create a custom model, run our model and the word2vec model training, and run experiments for the gender bias metrics that we were evaluating our training on.

PicPerfect,Travel bucket list creator,Jan 2021,gallery.jpeg,"PicPerfect is a bucket list creator, which uses Apify to scrape Tumbler for popular tourist destinations. A user can enter a search query for a country, our backend gets photo and location data from Tumblr and sends it to our React frontend through REST API. The user can choose the travel destinations that interest them and create their bucket list. Ultimately, the list can be downloaded for future reference. I worked on interfacing the backend to the frontend, web scraping with Apify, and the storing system for the bucket list.

FreshAir,Visualizer for air pollution around the world,Jul-Sep 2020,air.png,"FreshAir is a data visualization interface for air emissions across the world. It aims to encourage countries to improve their air quality and focus on air pollution reduction. On our site, air pollution is represented with a shade between white and black on an interactive world map. Pollution progression throughout the years is shown through graphs made with Amazon’s Sagemaker, and countries are ranked based on the number of tonnes of smog they emit. We also included additional information from the CRUX OECD - Air Emissions by Source dataset on the types of pollutants there are for each country and year. I worked on the React site which fed the data into our dynamic SVG map and visuals.

Snake AI,Snake game solver using graph algorithms,Mar-Apr 2020,snake.png,"“Magni’s Adventure” is a Snake AI solver that uses graph algorithms, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), a modified BFS and Hamilton, to solve the classic game of snake. The snake moves across the board to eat the red dots, and the game is won when the entire board is filled with the snake's body and no collisions occur with the body of the snake or the edges of the board. I used object-oriented programing to create the snake, red dots, and board and ran extensive tests to analyze the algorithms' performance, where Hamilton had a 100% success rate.
